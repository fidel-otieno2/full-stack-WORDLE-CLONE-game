# Wordle Frontend API Refactoring - Progress Tracking

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Environment Configuration
- [x] Created `.env` file with API URL configuration
- [x] Added axios dependency for better API handling

### 2. API Service Layer
- [x] Created `src/services/api.js` with axios-based API client
- [x] Implemented authentication endpoints (login, register, getUserStats)
- [x] Implemented game endpoints (getDailyWord, validateGuess, submitGameResult)
- [x] Added request/response interceptors for auth token handling
- [x] Created `src/services/auth.js` for JWT token management

### 3. App.jsx Refactoring
- [x] Replaced hardcoded word selection with API calls
- [x] Updated authentication to use JWT tokens
- [x] Replaced client-side guess validation with API calls
- [x] Added loading states and error handling
- [x] Updated state management for API responses
- [x] Added game result submission to backend

### 4. Component Updates
- [x] Updated Login component to support registration
- [x] Modified WordleBoard to work with API response data structure
- [x] Modified Keyboard to work with API response data structure
- [x] Added disabled states for loading scenarios
- [x] Added CSS styles for disabled keyboard buttons

### 5. Data Structure Changes
- [x] Updated guesses array to store objects with `{word, result, isCorrect}` instead of strings
- [x] Modified tile status calculation to use API results with client-side fallback
- [x] Updated key status calculation to use API results with client-side fallback

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

### 1. Testing & Verification
- [ ] Test login functionality with backend
- [ ] Test registration functionality with backend
- [ ] Test daily word fetching
- [ ] Test guess validation API calls
- [ ] Test game result submission
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Test loading states and UI feedback

### 2. Backend Integration
- [ ] Ensure backend endpoints match expected API structure
- [ ] Verify JWT token format and validation
- [ ] Test user authentication flow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify game data persistence

### 3. Error Handling Improvements
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- [ ] Improve error messages for users
- [ ] Add offline detection and messaging
- [ ] Handle network timeouts gracefully

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Add request caching where appropriate
- [ ] Implement request debouncing for rapid guesses
- [ ] Add loading skeletons for better UX

## ðŸ“‹ Notes

- The frontend is now fully API-driven and ready for backend integration
- All hardcoded game logic has been replaced with API calls
- Authentication system supports both login and registration
- Error handling and loading states are implemented
- Components gracefully handle both API responses and fallback to client-side logic
- The app maintains backward compatibility while being ready for backend integration

## ðŸš€ Ready for Backend Integration

The frontend is now structured to work with the following backend endpoints:

- `POST /login` - User authentication
- `POST /register` - User registration
- `GET /word` - Fetch daily word
- `POST /guess` - Validate user guess
- `POST /game` - Submit game results
- `GET /stats` - Fetch user statistics

All API calls include proper authentication headers and error handling.
